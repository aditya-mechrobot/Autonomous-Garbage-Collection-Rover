# Autonomous Garbage Collection Rover
This project presents a prototype of an **autonomous garbage collection unit** developed as part of my final year engineering project.
The system is designed to detect and collect waste autonomously using sensor inputs and mechanical components, reducing human effort in public waste management
## Overview
The robot is designed to navigate along a predefined path, detect garbage using sensors, and collect it using a servo-based mechanism. This project integrates mechanical design, embedded systems, and automation principles.

## Rover CAD Design
